# Canton Wallet Overview

We're building a crypto wallet that lets you log in with your face or fingerprint instead of seed phrases. It runs on Canton Network, so your transactions stay private.

## What It Does

**Input:** Your biometric authentication (face, fingerprint, or hardware key)  
**Output:** Send and receive Canton Coin privately  
**How:** WebAuthn passkeys replace seed phrases, Canton Network hides transaction details

## Why This Matters

Seed phrases are terrible UX and a massive security risk. Most people either lose them or store them insecurely. Meanwhile, every transaction on public blockchains is visible forever.

Canton Wallet fixes both problems: no seed phrases to lose, no public transaction history to expose your financial activity.

## What You Get

- **No seed phrases:** Login with biometrics like you do with your banking app
- **Private transactions:** Canton Network keeps amounts and recipients confidential
- **Institutional security:** Same WebAuthn standards banks and enterprises use
- **Canton ecosystem access:** Gateway to privacy-first DeFi applications
