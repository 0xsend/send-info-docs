# Canton Wallet Safe

Safe is the multisig built for Canton teams that want passkey-grade security with treasury-level controls. It lets you require multiple approvers on any transfer while keeping the biometric UX that already secures Canton Wallet.

## What Safe Provides

- **Shared ownership:** Any asset inside Safe requires a quorum before it can move.
- **Device-level security:** Every signer authenticates with their Canton Wallet passkeys removing the need to manage seed phrases or browser extensions.
- **Policy transparency:** Thresholds, roles, and pending transactions are always visible to every signer in the safe dashboard.
- **Private settlement:** Transactions execute on Canton Network, so counterparties and amounts stay confidential even when multiple signers participate.

## Create a Safe

1. Open Canton Wallet, navigate to **Canton Wallet → Safe**, and select **Create Safe**.
2. Name the safe and pick a unique name.
3. Define the safe's signing threshhold: `m-of-n` (default to majority)
4. Add signer party ids or Canton Wallet usernames. Invitations stay pending until each signer accepts from their wallet.
5. Fund the safe by transferring assets from an existing Canton Wallet or importing an onchain balance using the provided deposit address.

Safe stays in a draft state until the final signer joins and the funding transaction finalizes. Draft safes cannot hold assets.

## Using a Safe

We designed Safe to feel like using your traditional primary account. Once your safe is active, swap to your Safe account in the party selector in the navigation bar. From there, you will be able to propose transactions and send out transactions as you normally would using the app.

## Managing a Safe

- **Add signer:** Requires an existing quorum to approve and new signers must accept the invite.
- **Remove signer:** Requires existing quorum to approve.
- **Modify threshhold:** Requires existing quorum to approve.
