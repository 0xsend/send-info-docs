# Canton Wallet Safe

Safe is the multisig built for Canton teams that want passkey-grade security with treasury-level controls. It lets you require multiple approvers on any transfer while keeping the biometric UX that already secures Canton Wallet.

## What Safe Provides

- **Shared ownership:** Any asset inside Safe requires a quorum before it can move.
- **Device-level security:** Every signer authenticates with their Canton Wallet passkeys removing the need to manage seed phrases or browser extensions.
- **Policy transparency:** Thresholds, roles, and pending transactions are always visible to every signer in the safe dashboard.
- **Private settlement:** Transactions execute on Canton Network, so counterparties and amounts stay confidential even when multiple signers participate.

## Current Rollout

Safe is in limited launch. Early teams receive invite links inside Canton Wallet under **Canton Wallet → Safe (beta)**. Broader access will unlock after the public launch window closes and migration tooling is complete.

## Requirements

1. Each signer must already control an active Canton Wallet with at least two enrolled passkeys (primary + backup).
2. Teams should align on threshold logic before inviting additional signers (e.g., 2-of-3 for day-to-day ops, 3-of-5 for treasury sweeps).
3. Minimum deposit is 100 CC during the beta; limits will raise after performance validation.

## Create a Safe

1. Open Canton Wallet, navigate to **Canton Wallet → Safe**, and select **Create Safe**.
2. Name the safe and pick a unique slug; this cannot be changed later.
3. Define the safe's signing threshhold: `m-of-n` (default to majority)
4. Add signer party ids or Canton Wallet usernames. Invitations stay pending until each signer accepts from their wallet.
5. Fund the safe by transferring assets from an existing Canton Wallet or importing an onchain balance using the provided deposit address.

Safe stays in a draft state until the final signer joins and the funding transaction finalizes. Draft safes cannot hold assets.

## Propose & Approve Transfers

1. Any signer can propose a transfer by selecting **New Proposal**, entering the destination address, asset, and amount.
2. The proposal is staged on Canton Network and split into discreet approval slots equal to the threshold.
3. Approvals happen inside Canton Wallet with the same passkey prompt they use for personal transfers.
4. Once the threshold is met, Canton executes the transfer and posts a completion receipt in the safe activity log.

## Managing Signers

- **Add signer:** Requires an existing quorum to approve and new signers must accept the invite.
- **Remove signer:** Requires existing quorum to approve.

## Operational Tips

- Keep at least one hardware-key signer enrolled for disaster recovery.
- Review the activity log weekly; every proposal includes timestamps, initiator, and signer attestations for audit trails.
- Export CSV summaries from the Activity tab if you need offline reconciliation or compliance records.
