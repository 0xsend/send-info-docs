# Canton Coin Rewards

Canton Wallet delivers $CC credits through scheduled drip cycles once an enrolled wallet maintains the required $SEND balance. Rewards deposit to the same passkey-secured wallet described in the [overview](./overview).

## Eligibility

- Canton Wallet account set up with your passkey.
- Purchase a Sendtag.
- At least $40 held in Savings.
- Minimum 3,000 $SEND maintained in your balance.

## Reward Model
We are currently experimenting with a linear rewards model for $CC credit distribution based on $SEND holdings. This replaces our previous tiered system with a more proportional approach to rewards.
More detailed information about the linear model rates and calculations will be announced soon. Qualified participants will continue to receive rewards during this transition.

## Activate Rewards

1. Purchase a Sendtag.
2. Deposit $40 or more into Savings.
3. Hold at least 3,000 $SEND in your account.
4. Enable transfer pre-approval in Canton Wallet.
5. Enable Auto Merge in Canton Wallet. 
6. Open the Canton Wallet tab on <a href="https://send.app/canton-wallet" className="multisig-token-link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Send.app ↗</a>.
7. Verify your Canton Wallet address in the address field.

After these steps, your wallet is queued for the next drip cycle. No manual claim is required, but allow time for the payout schedule to process. Keep your passkey devices enrolled to retain access and continue receiving $CC.

> **Payout cadence:** Distribution cycles can vary. There is no guaranteed hourly rate or fixed frequency for $CC credits, so timing may differ between drip runs.
