## Activate Rewards

1. Purchase a `/sendtag` and link it to your Send app profile.
2. Deposit $30 or more into Savings.
3. Hold at least 1,000 $SEND in your account.
4. Enable transfer pre-approval so inbound $CC can settle automatically.
5. Open the Rewards tab on <a href="http://send.app" className="multisig-token-link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Send.app â†—</a>.
6. Add your Canton Wallet address in the Rewards form.

After these steps, your wallet is queued for the next drip cycle. No manual claim is required, but allow time for the payout schedule to process. Keep your passkey devices enrolled to retain access and continue receiving $CC.

> **Payout cadence:** Distribution cycles can vary. There is no guaranteed hourly rate or fixed frequency for $CC credits, so timing may differ between drip runs.
