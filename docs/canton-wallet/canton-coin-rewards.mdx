# Canton Coin Rewards

Canton Wallet is entering an important new phase. The CC drip has onboarded 25,855 parties and linked 233.72M SEND through Canton Wallet—bootstrapping early participation and strengthening the Canton Network in its earliest stage. As the network matures, the drip is being phased out and will be fully removed by December 25, with future rewards shifting to staking-based programs and product-driven incentives.

## Current Status

Canton Network guidance calls for reduced “elastic” activity across all apps. The CC drip is tapering on this schedule:

- By December 3: ~50% reduction
- By December 10: ~75% reduction
- By December 17: ~87.5% reduction
- By December 25: Full removal

We are preparing a more durable rewards model built around staked CC (stCC), staked SEND (stSEND), and rewards tied to upcoming applications such as Safe, Pool Party, and CUSD. A secure bridge solution is being explored to enable staking-based rewards.

## Eligibility (while the drip remains active)

- Canton Wallet account set up with your passkey.
- Minimum 3,000 $SEND maintained in your balance.

## Reward Model

We’re currently using a linear rewards model for $CC credit distribution based on $SEND holdings (replacing the old tiered model). Distribution amounts will continue to shrink as the reductions above take effect ahead of the December 25 sunset.

## Activate Rewards (before sunset)

1. Hold at least 3,000 $SEND in your account.
2. Enable transfer pre-approval in Canton Wallet.
3. Enable Auto Merge in Canton Wallet. 
4. Open the Canton Wallet tab on <a href="https://send.app/canton-wallet" className="multisig-token-link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Send.app ↗</a>.
5. Verify your Canton Wallet address in the address field.

After these steps, your wallet is queued for the next drip cycle. No manual claim is required, but allow time for the payout schedule to process. Keep your passkey devices enrolled to retain access and continue receiving $CC while the program winds down.

> **Payout cadence:** Distribution cycles can vary. There is no guaranteed hourly rate or fixed frequency for $CC credits, and timing may differ between drip runs, especially during the reduction period.
