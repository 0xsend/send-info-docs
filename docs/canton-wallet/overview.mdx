# Canton Wallet Overview

Canton Wallet is a passkey-first crypto wallet that lets you log in with your face or fingerprint instead of memorizing seed phrases. It runs on Canton Network, so your transactions stay private end to end.

## What It Does

**Input:** Your biometric authentication (face, fingerprint, or hardware key)  
**Output:** Send and receive Canton Coin privately  
**How:** WebAuthn passkeys replace seed phrases, Canton Network hides transaction details

## Why This Matters

Seed phrases are terrible UX and a massive security risk. Most people either lose them or store them insecurely. Meanwhile, every transaction on public blockchains is visible forever.

Canton Wallet fixes both problems today: no seed phrases to lose, no public transaction history to expose your financial activity.

## What You Get

- **No seed phrases:** Log in with biometrics like you do with your banking app
- **Private transactions:** Canton Network keeps amounts and recipients confidential
- **Institutional security:** Same WebAuthn standards banks and enterprises use
- **Live ecosystem access:** Gateway to privacy-first DeFi applications and future Send integrations

## Getting Started

1. Visit <a href="https://cantonwallet.com" className="multisig-token-link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">CantonWallet.com ↗</a> on a passkey-capable device.
2. Create or select the passkey you want to use (Face ID, Touch ID, Windows Hello, or a hardware security key).
3. Approve the Canton Wallet enrollment prompt and confirm your recovery device if prompted.
4. Start sending and receiving Canton Coin with private settlement on Canton Network.

## Security FAQ

- **Is face login secure?** Yes. Passkeys require possession of your trusted device and a successful biometric unlock. Spoofed photos or video replays fail because the device performs hardware-level liveness checks before releasing your credential.
- **Do attackers need my phone?** Yes. Without the physical device, the passkey cannot be used, and even with the device, they still need your biometric or device passcode.
- **What counts as a hardware key?** Any FIDO2/WebAuthn security key (like YubiKey or Feitian) that plugs into or pairs with your device. You can enroll one as an additional passkey for extra assurance.
