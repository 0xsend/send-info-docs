# Wallet Maintenance

Routine upkeep keeps Canton Wallet responsive and avoids unnecessary network fees. The actions below explain how to manage automated transfers and optimize your unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs).

## Enable Transfer Pre-Approval

Transfer pre-approval automatically accepts incoming Canton Coin transfers without showing a confirmation prompt.

:::info Rewards drip requirement
To receive the ongoing $CC drip documented in [Canton Coin Rewards](./canton-coin-rewards), a wallet must have transfer pre-approval enabled so incoming credits settle without manual approval.
:::

### Benefits

- Automatic acceptance of inbound $CC transfers  
- No manual confirmation workflow  
- Faster completion for frequent or scheduled transfers

### Considerations

- Enabling the feature deploys a contract on Canton Network.  
- The authorization is auto-renewed by the validator operator.  
- You cannot disable pre-approval after activation, so confirm the requirement with your treasury policies before proceeding.

## Consolidate UTXOs

Each Canton Wallet balance is stored as individual UTXOsâ€”similar to holding many small bills. Large numbers of UTXOs increase holding fees and slow down signing operations. Consolidation merges the fragments into fewer, larger outputs.

### Why Consolidate

- Lower aggregate holding fees  
- Faster transaction signing and broadcasting  
- Cleaner wallet state for future transactions

### How It Works

1. Open the UTXO consolidation prompt when the wallet surfaces an alert.  
2. Select **Send max consolidatable amount** to route the recommended total back to your own Canton Wallet address.  
3. Approve the self-transfer; the wallet merges the source UTXOs into fewer outputs automatically.

Allow the transaction to finalize on Canton Network before initiating time-sensitive transfers.
