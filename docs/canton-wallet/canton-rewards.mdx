# Canton Rewards

Canton Wallet distributes $CC in scheduled tranches once an enrolled wallet maintains the required $SEND balance. Credits settle to the same passkey-secured wallet described in the [overview](./overview).

## Eligibility

- Canton Wallet account set up with your passkey.
- Active `/sendtag` connected to your Send profile.
- At least $30 held in Savings.
- Minimum 2,000 $SEND maintained in your balance.

## Reward Tiers

| $SEND balance (min) | $CC reward |
| ------------------- | ----------------- |
| 2,000               | 1                 |
| 4,000               | 2                 |
| 6,000               | 3                 |
| 8,000               | 4                 |

Balances above a tier receive the corresponding reward. Tiers with balances of more than 50k will be introduced at some point in the near future. 

## Activate Rewards

1. Purchase a `/sendtag` and link it to your Send app profile.
2. Deposit $30 or more into Savings.
3. Hold at least 2,000 $SEND in your account.
4. Open the Rewards tab on <a href="http://send.app" className="multisig-token-link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Send.app â†—</a>.
5. Add your Canton Wallet address in the Rewards form.

After these steps, your wallet is queued for the next distribution tranche. No manual claim is required, but allow time for the payout cycle to process. Keep your passkey devices enrolled to retain access and continue receiving $CC.
