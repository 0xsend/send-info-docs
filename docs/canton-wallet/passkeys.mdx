# Canton Wallet Passkeys

Passkeys let Canton Wallet owners authenticate with platform biometrics or hardware security keys instead of seed phrases. Only devices that you explicitly enroll can authorize transactions.

## How Passkeys Work

- Canton Wallet uses WebAuthn to bind a cryptographic credential to each trusted device.  
- The credential never leaves the device; authentication is completed locally before a signed request is sent to Canton's private settlement network.  
- You can enroll multiple devices (e.g., primary phone plus a hardware key) so you have a recovery option if a device is lost.

## Non-Custodial Control

Canton Wallet is non-custodial. Your passkeys and devices are the only way to authorize movements of $SEND, $CC, or other supported assets. Send cannot access, freeze, or transfer funds on your behalf.

## Responsibility & Risk

- Keep at least one backup passkey (hardware key or secondary device) stored separately from your primary device.  
- If you lose every enrolled credential, Send cannot recover the wallet for you and any assets inside remain inaccessible.  
- Review [Canton Wallet Overview](./overview) for setup guidance before enrolling devices.  
- All balances are under your sole control. Send is not responsible for losses arising from misplaced devices, compromised hardware, or unauthorized access that results from weak local security controls.
