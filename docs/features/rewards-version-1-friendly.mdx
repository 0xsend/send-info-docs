# Rewards - How It Works

Welcome! This guide explains how SEND rewards work in simple terms. Think of it like a loyalty program that pays you back for using your money.

## The Big Picture

```mermaid

    A[You Hold SEND] --> B[You Send SEND]
    B --> C[You Earn Rewards]
    C --> D[More SEND to Spend!]
    D --> A
```

SEND rewards you for actually using your money, not just sitting on it. The more you send to friends and family, the more you earn back!

## Step 1: Get Verified

Before you can earn rewards, you need to prove you're a real person. Here's what you need:

```mermaid

    A[Start Here] --> B[Deposit {{REWARDS_DEPOSIT_USDC}} USDC]
    B --> C[Claim Your Sendtag]
    C --> D[Hold {{REWARDS_HOLD_SEND}} SEND]
    D --> E[You're Verified!]
```

Once verified, you're in the rewards club!

## Step 2: Hold to Set Your Limit

Your SEND balance decides how much you can earn. Think of it like a bucket - the more SEND you hold, the bigger your bucket can fill with rewards.

```

## Step 3: Send to Earn

This is the fun part! Every time you send SEND to someone:

- Your progress bar fills up
- You get closer to your monthly rewards
- The more you send, the more you earn

```mermaid

    subgraph Monthly Cycle
        A[Send SEND] --> B[Progress Increases]
        B --> C[Earn Rewards]
        C --> A
    end
```
