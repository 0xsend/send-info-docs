# Send Rewards Guide

Welcome to Send Rewards! This guide explains how you can earn SEND tokens just by using the app and inviting friends.

## What Are Send Rewards?

Every month, Send distributes millions of SEND tokens to active users. The more you use the app and invite friends, the more rewards you earn.

## How to Earn Rewards

### Complete Tasks

Earn SEND by completing simple tasks:

- **Create a Passkey** - Set up your secure login
- **Purchase a Sendtag** - Get your unique @username
- **Send to 10+ People** - Make transfers to at least 10 different recipients
- **Send to 100+ People** - Make transfers to at least 100 different recipients
- **Build a Send Streak** - Send to someone every day in a row

### Referral Marketing

One of the best ways to boost your rewards is through referrals. When you invite friends to Send and they become active users, you earn bonus multipliers on your rewards.

**How Referrals Work:**

1. Share your Sendtag with friends
2. When they sign up using your referral, you're connected as their referrer
3. Once your friend qualifies for rewards (by earning a share in a distribution), your referral counts

**Boosting Your Rewards with Referrals:**

Your referrals multiply your base rewards in two ways:

1. **Monthly Referral Multiplier**: For each friend who joins and qualifies in the current month, you get a 10% boost (1.1x, 1.2x, 1.3x...) up to 2x total

2. **Total Referral Multiplier**: Your lifetime qualified referrals give you an ongoing 2% boost per referral (1.02x, 1.04x, 1.06x...) up to 2x total

**Example:**
If you refer 3 friends this month who all qualify, and you have 10 total lifetime referrals:
- Monthly boost: 1.3x (3 referrals x 0.1 each)
- Total boost: 1.20x (10 referrals x 0.02 each)
- Combined multiplier: 1.3 x 1.2 = 1.56x your base rewards!

**Tips to Maximize Referrals:**

- Share your Sendtag on social media
- Invite friends who will actively use Send
- Help your referrals complete their first transactions so they qualify for rewards
- The more friends who qualify, the bigger your multiplier grows

## Qualification Requirements

To qualify for monthly rewards, you need:

1. **Hold SEND** - Maintain the minimum SEND balance (currently 10,000 SEND)
2. **Own a Sendtag** - Have at least one confirmed Sendtag
3. **Deposit to Send Earn** - Keep the minimum savings balance (currently $50 USDC)

## When Are Rewards Distributed?

Rewards are calculated at the end of each month and become available to claim shortly after. Check the Rewards tab in the app to see your current status and claim your rewards.
