# Send Checks

Send crypto to anyone using a shareable link — no wallet address needed.

## Overview

Send Checks lets you send cryptocurrency to anyone by creating a shareable claim link. Recipients don't need to know your wallet address, and you don't need theirs. Simply create a check, share the link, and the recipient can claim the funds by registering or signing into Send.

## How It Works

### For Senders

1. **Create a Check**
   - Tap "Send Check" from the send screen
   - Choose the token and enter the amount you want to send
   - Set an expiration date for the check
   - Optionally add a note for the recipient
   - Confirm and sign the transaction

2. **Share the Link**
   - After creation, you'll receive a unique claim URL
   - **Important:** Save this link before leaving — if lost, you'll need to cancel the check to recover funds
   - Share the link via text, email, or any messaging app

3. **Manage Your Checks**
   - View all sent checks in the "Manage Checks" screen
   - See check status: Pending, Claimed, Expired, or Canceled
   - Cancel unclaimed checks to recover your funds

### For Recipients

1. **Receive a Link**
   - Someone shares a Send Check link with you

2. **Claim Your Funds**
   - Open the link in your browser
   - If you have a Send account: Sign in to claim
   - If you're new: Register to create an account and claim

3. **Funds Added**
   - Once claimed, the tokens are immediately added to your Send wallet
