# Referrals

Send's referral program rewards you for introducing new people to private, borderless finance. Whether you are helping a friend set up their first Passkey or onboarding a business partner, successful referrals earn you ongoing Send Fee rebates.

## How It Works

1. Share your unique referral link from the Send app. It is tied to your primary Sendtag.
2. Your contact signs up, secures their account with a Passkey, and completes onboarding.
3. You both qualify for rewards once the referred account becomes active (Passkey setup plus at least one successful transfer).

## Reward Structure

- **Referral Bonus:** You and the referred user each receive a Send Fee credit once the activation criteria are met.
- **Activity Multiplier:** Additional Send Fee credits accumulate if the referred account maintains weekly activity for four consecutive weeks.
- **Transparency:** Credits appear in the Rewards tab inside the app where you can track amounts earned and expiration dates.

Referral rewards will expand to cover forthcoming CUSD savings and future staking programs. Final percentages will be published ahead of the public Canton rollout.

## Best Practices

- Guide new users through Passkey enrollment to ensure they qualify quickly.
- Encourage them to claim a Sendtag so transfers are simple from day one.
- Remind them to complete at least one meaningful transfer in their first week; it keeps the bonus window open.

## Staying Updated

Open the Rewards â†’ Referrals section in the Send app for the latest credit amounts, eligible regions, and program terms. We will update this doc as soon as the Canton incentives go live.
