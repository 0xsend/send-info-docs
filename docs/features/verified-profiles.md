# Verified Profiles on Send

:::info Live Date
These requirements are live as of September 27, 2025.
:::

Send's verified profile badge appears automatically after you complete three trust steps:

1. **Deposit 20 USDC into savings:** Move at least 20 USDC into your Send savings vault to confirm you have an active balance.
2. **Purchase a Sendtag:** Claim a unique Sendtag through the in-app marketplace so other members can find you easily.
3. **Hold 7,000 $SEND:** Maintain a minimum balance of 7,000 SEND tokens in your primary wallet. Keep the tokens in place to retain verification.

Meet all three requirements and the badge turns on instantly. If any requirement drops below the minimum (for example, you withdraw from savings or sell SEND), the badge turns off until you meet the criteria again.
