# Verified Profiles on Send

<Callout type="info" title="Live Date">
  These requirements are live as of October 1, 2025.
</Callout>

Send's verified profile badge appears automatically after you complete three trust steps:

1. **Deposit {{REWARDS_DEPOSIT_USDC}} USDC into savings:** Move at least {{REWARDS_DEPOSIT_USDC}} USDC into your Send savings vault to confirm you have an active balance.
2. **Purchase a Sendtag:** Claim a unique Sendtag through the in-app marketplace so other members can find you easily.
3. **Hold {{REWARDS_HOLD_SEND}} $SEND:** Maintain a minimum balance of {{REWARDS_HOLD_SEND}} SEND tokens in your primary wallet. Keep the tokens in place to retain verification.
4. **Send: Send to one Verified /send User.

Meet all four requirements and the badge turns on instantly. If any requirement drops below the minimum (for example, you withdraw from savings or sell SEND), the badge turns off until you meet the criteria again.
