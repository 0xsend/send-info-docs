# SEND Rewards System

The SEND rewards framework incentivizes active participation in the network. This document provides a comprehensive overview of the qualification criteria, earning mechanics, and distribution model.

## System Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Qualification
        V[Verification] --> Q{Qualified?}
        Q -->|Yes| E[Earnings Pool]
        Q -->|No| X[No Rewards]
    end

    subgraph Earning
        E --> H[Holdings Cap]
        E --> S[Send Activity]
        H & S --> R[Reward Calculation]
    end

    subgraph Distribution
        R --> M[Monthly Payout]
        M --> B[Balance Update]
    end
```

## Verification Requirements

Users must complete three verification steps to qualify for rewards:

| Requirement | Threshold | Purpose |
|------------|-----------|---------|
| USDC Deposit | {{REWARDS_DEPOSIT_USDC}} USDC | Proof of funds |
| Sendtag | 1 claimed | Identity verification |
| SEND Holdings | {{REWARDS_HOLD_SEND}} SEND | Network commitment |

```mermaid

    U->>S: Deposit USDC
    S->>S: Verify deposit
    U->>S: Claim Sendtag
    S->>S: Verify identity
    U->>S: Hold SEND
    S->>R: Mark as qualified
    R->>U: Enable rewards tracking
```

## Earning Mechanics

### Holdings-Based Cap

Your SEND holdings determine your maximum earning potential each cycle:

```mermaid

    A[SEND Holdings] --> B[Earning Cap]
    B --> C[Monthly Maximum]

    style A fill:#e1f5fe
    style B fill:#b3e5fc
    style C fill:#81d4fa
```

### Activity-Based Progress

Sending activity fills your progress toward the earning cap:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Progress Calculation
        S[Send Transaction] --> P[Progress +%]
        P --> C{Cap Reached?}
        C -->|No| S
        C -->|Yes| M[Max Rewards Unlocked]
    end
```

## Reward Distribution Model

```mermaid
pie title Monthly Reward Allocation
    "Spending Rewards" : 33
    "Holding Rewards" : 33
    "Activity Bonuses" : 20
    "Task Multipliers" : 14
```

### Distribution Timeline

| Phase | Timing | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Tracking | Ongoing | Activity recorded |
| Calculation | Month end | Rewards computed |
| Distribution | 1st of month | SEND distributed |

## Task & Multiplier System

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    T[Complete Task] --> B[Base Bonus]
    B --> S{Streak Active?}
    S -->|Yes| M[Apply Multiplier]
    S -->|No| R[Standard Reward]
    M --> R
    R --> A[Add to Account]
```

### Available Tasks

- Referral completions
- Verification maintenance
- Consistent sending activity
- Special promotional tasks

## Fairness Considerations

The system implements diminishing returns for large holders:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Diminishing Returns
        A[Small Holder] --> |Linear Growth| B[Proportional Rewards]
        C[Large Holder] --> |Logarithmic Growth| D[Capped Rewards]
    end
```

This ensures sustainable distribution while maintaining incentives for all participation levels.
