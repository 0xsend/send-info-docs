# Send Rewards System

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Send rewards distribution system, including qualification criteria, verification types, and the referral marketing program.

## Overview

Send distributes SEND tokens monthly to qualified users through a structured verification and multiplier system. Each distribution allocates a fixed pool of tokens based on user activities and engagement metrics.

## Qualification Criteria

Users must meet the following requirements to qualify for a distribution:

| Requirement | Current Threshold |
|-------------|-------------------|
| SEND Balance | 10,000 SEND minimum |
| Sendtag | At least one confirmed Sendtag |
| Send Earn Deposit | $50 USDC minimum |

## Verification Types

The rewards system tracks multiple verification types, each contributing to the user's total reward:

| Verification Type | Description | Fixed Value |
|-------------------|-------------|-------------|
| `create_passkey` | Account creation with passkey | 100 SEND |
| `tag_registration` | Sendtag ownership (weighted by tag length) | 100 SEND base |
| `send_ten` | 10+ unique transfer recipients | 100 SEND |
| `send_one_hundred` | 100+ unique transfer recipients | 500 SEND |
| `send_streak` | Consecutive days with transfers | 10 SEND per day |
| `send_ceiling` | Score-based ceiling verification | Variable |

## Referral Marketing

The referral program provides multiplicative bonuses that significantly increase reward earnings.

### How Referrals Are Tracked

When a new user signs up using another user's Sendtag as a referral, a referral relationship is established. Referrals qualify when the referred user earns a share with `amount > 0` in the previous distribution.

### Referral Multiplier Types

**1. Monthly Referral Multiplier (`tag_referral`)**

Rewards users for new referrals within the current distribution period.

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Multiplier Min | 1.1 (10% boost) |
| Multiplier Max | 2.0 (100% boost) |
| Multiplier Step | 0.1 per qualified referral |

Each qualified referral in the current month adds 10% to your multiplier, starting at 1.1x for the first referral, up to a maximum of 2.0x.

**2. Cumulative Referral Multiplier (`total_tag_referrals`)**

Rewards users for their lifetime accumulated qualified referrals.

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Multiplier Min | 1.02 (2% boost) |
| Multiplier Max | 2.0 (100% boost) |
| Multiplier Step | 0.02 per qualified referral |

Your total lifetime referral count provides an ongoing 2% boost per referral, compounding up to 2.0x maximum.

### Multiplier Calculation

All multipliers are applied multiplicatively to the user's fixed pool allocation:

```
Final Reward = Base Fixed Amount × (tag_referral multiplier) × (total_tag_referrals multiplier) × (other multipliers...)
```

Each multiplier type is capped at its respective `multiplier_max` before multiplication.

### Referral Qualification Rule

A referral is considered "qualified" when the referred user:
- Has a distribution share record in the previous distribution
- Has a share amount greater than zero

This ensures referrers are rewarded for bringing in genuinely active users who participate in the rewards program.

### Maximizing Referral Benefits

1. **Encourage Activity**: Help referred users complete verification tasks (passkey creation, Sendtag purchase, making transfers)
2. **Sustained Growth**: The cumulative multiplier rewards consistent referral activity over time
3. **Compound Effect**: Monthly and total referral multipliers stack multiplicatively, creating significant reward amplification

### Example Calculation

User with base fixed amount of 500 SEND:
- 5 qualified referrals this month: tag_referral multiplier = min(1.1 + 0.1×4, 2.0) = 1.5x
- 25 total lifetime referrals: total_tag_referrals multiplier = min(1.02 + 0.02×24, 2.0) = 1.50x
- Combined multiplier effect: 1.5 × 1.5 = 2.25x (capped per-type, then multiplied)
- Final reward: 500 × 2.25 = 1,125 SEND

## Distribution Schedule

Distributions occur monthly with qualification periods aligned to calendar months (UTC timezone). Rewards become claimable after the distribution is processed and merkle proofs are generated.
