# Rewards

Send rewards users for actively participating in and growing the ecosystem. The rewards system has evolved to encourage genuine usage of the platform rather than just holding tokens. Here's how it works:

**Active Usage Rewards**
* You earn rewards for key actions like:
   * Setting up a Passkey
   * Creating Sendtags
   * Making regular transfers to different users
   * Maintaining daily activity on the platform
   * Referring new users to Send

**The Send Slash: Encouraging Real Usage** Send introduced the "Send Slash" mechanism to promote authentic platform usage. Here's what you need to know:
* To earn full rewards, you're expected to send about one-third of your previous month's rewards
* The system tracks your transfers to unique users
* Larger and more frequent transfers to different users increase your reward potential
* There are protections in place to prevent gaming the system (like sending back and forth with a single user)

**Time-Based Distribution**
* Rewards accumulate gradually throughout the month
* This provides a smoother, more predictable rewards experience
* You can watch your rewards grow as you use the platform

**Best Practices for Maximizing Rewards**
* Make regular, meaningful transfers to different users
* Stay active on the platform daily
* Engage with the ecosystem's features (Passkeys, Sendtags)
* Help grow the network by referring new users

This rewards system is designed to benefit users who integrate Send into their regular financial activities, rather than those who simply hold tokens or try to game the system.
