# Passkeys

Send is a non-custodial platform accessible to anyone with a smartphone, anywhere in the world. Passkeys make joining Send as simple as using your face, fingerprint, or passcode – no passwords to create, remember, or reset.

When you create your Send account, Passkeys secure your funds using the same security you trust to unlock your phone. This means you maintain complete control of your money while enjoying simple, instant access.

The best part? Getting started takes less than a minute. No bank verification, no complex documentation, no waiting periods. Passkeys make Send truly borderless – whether you're in New York or Nigeria, you can start sending, saving, and growing your money.
