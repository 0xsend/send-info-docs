# Savings

The Send Savings feature allows you to earn interest on your USDC, similar to a high-yield savings account but with potentially better rates. Simply deposit your USDC into the Savings vault and start earning interest right away. Your funds remain accessible, and you can withdraw them at any time.

## How It Works

- Interest begins accumulating immediately
- Returns are automatically reinvested to maximize growth
- Track your earnings in real-time through the Send app
- Access your funds plus earned interest whenever you need them

## Key Benefits

- **Higher Interest Rates**: Earn competitive returns on your USDC
- **No Lock-up Periods**: Access your money whenever you need it
- **Low Minimum Deposit**: Start earning with as little as 5 USDC
- **Secure Infrastructure**: Your funds are protected by robust security measures
- **Full Control**: Maintain complete ownership of your money at all times

## Safety and Security

Send Earn is non-custodial, meaning you always maintain full control and ownership of your funds. Unlike traditional banks, we never take possession of your money - you remain in control of your assets at all times.

We've built multiple layers of security to protect your funds:

- Regular third-party security audits verify the safety of our systems
- Automated risk management monitors activity 24/7
- Conservative lending strategies that prioritize security over aggressive returns

## Behind the Scenes

Send Earn operates similarly to traditional bank lending but with enhanced efficiency and transparency. Your deposited USDC is put to work through established lending protocols (<a href="https://moonwell.fi/" className="multisig-token-link" target="_blank">Moonwell ↗</a> and <a href="https://morpho.org/" className="multisig-token-link" target="_blank">Morpho ↗</a>) that have been thoroughly tested and secured. These protocols facilitate lending to verified borrowers who pay interest, which is then shared with you as a depositor.

Our lending strategy focuses on security and sustainability:

- All lending is done against blue-chip digital assets only
- Borrowing is overcollateralized with conservative loan-to-value ratios for added security
- Risk management is handled by industry leaders <a href="https://blockanalitica.com/" className="multisig-token-link" target="_blank">BlockAnalitica ↗</a> and <a href="https://www.bprotocol.org/" className="multisig-token-link" target="_blank">B.Protocol ↗</a>, who collectively advise projects managing over $12 billion in assets

Unlike traditional banks that often keep lending practices opaque, Send Earn's operations are transparent and verifiable. Our lending protocols maintain conservative risk parameters and automated safeguards to ensure the security of your deposits while generating competitive returns.
