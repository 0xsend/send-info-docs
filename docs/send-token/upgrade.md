# Upgrade

:::info Token Upgrade Complete
Send upgraded its token from 100B supply to 1B supply on January 19, 2025.
:::

## Here's what you need to know:

The total SEND token supply is being reduced from 100B to 1B tokens. Your token balance will be adjusted proportionally (divided by 100), maintaining your same percentage of ownership in the ecosystem.

We're also moving our liquidity pools from Uniswap to Aerodrome:

- USDC/SEND pool will migrate to Aerodrome
- The market cap and value of your tokens will remain unchanged during this transition

## Important Notes

:::warning Mandatory Upgrade
- Your proportional ownership remains exactly the same
- This upgrade is mandatory to continue using the Send app
- The upgrade process is one-time only and cannot be reversed
- If you deposit any old SEND Tokens into the app after upgrading, you'll need to upgrade those tokens as well
:::

## What You Need to Do

**Step 1:** Click the "Upgrade" button when prompted

**Step 2:** Approve the transaction with your Passkey

**Step 3:** Your tokens will automatically convert to the new format

:::tip Upgrade Location
Send.app is the only way to upgrade your tokens. You must deposit your SEND v0 tokens into the app to complete the upgrade process.

## Example Conversion

| Before Upgrade | After Upgrade | Your Ownership |
|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| 100,000 SEND tokens | 1,000 SEND tokens | **Same proportion** |

If you currently hold 100,000 SEND tokens, after the upgrade you will have 1,000 SEND tokens, representing the same proportion of the total supply.
