# Send App FAQs

Answers to frequently asked questions about using the Send App, account setup, features, and security.

## Getting Started

### How do I create an account and set up my passkey?

Go to send.app and choose Create account, then register a passkey using Face ID, Touch ID, or a hardware key. The passkey becomes your login credential, so there are no passwords or seed phrases to store. iOS and Android apps are also available.

### What features are available once my account is active?

You can send and receive money, deposit to a savings vault and earn interest, invest in crypto assets including $SEND token, and participate in our rewards program. Digital bank accounts and cards coming soon.

### Is Send App available on mobile devices?

Yes. Send App is available as a native app on both iOS and Android. You can also access it via web browser at send.app.

## Sending & Receiving

### Are there fees or limits on sending money?

Currently we charge 1 cent per transaction plus gas costs. Soon all transactions will be free on Send.

### What currencies can I send and receive?

You can send and receive USDC, CUSD, and other supported tokens within the Send ecosystem.

### How do I send money to someone?

Enter the recipient's Sendtag or wallet address, specify the amount, and confirm the transaction with your passkey.

## Devices & Security

### Can I use the same wallet on multiple devices?

Yes. To add a device, go to Settings > Passkeys and add a passkey from the additional device. You'll need to confirm the new passkey using your already approved passkey. Without this approval, you won't be able to execute any transactions on the new device.

### What happens if I lose a device or need to reset my passkey?

Send is non-custodial, which means we don't have access to your account or passkeys. If you lose a device, you can log in from another device where you've backed up your passkey. It's important to back up your passkeys to multiple devices, use a password manager, or save your passkey to the cloud. Without a backup, you cannot recover your account.

### How do I remove a device from my account?

Go to Settings > Passkeys, find the device you want to remove, and revoke its access. This will prevent that device from accessing your account.

## Savings & Rewards

### How does the savings vault work?

Deposit USDC into the savings vault to earn interest. Your funds remain accessible while generating yield through secure DeFi protocols.

### How do I earn rewards in Send App?

Use Send regularly—send money, hold $SEND tokens, and participate in ecosystem activities. Rewards are distributed based on your activity level and $SEND holdings.

### Where can I see my rewards?

Your rewards balance and history are displayed in the Rewards section of the Send App.

## Sendtags

### What is a Sendtag?

A Sendtag is your unique username on Send, making it easy for others to send you money without needing your full wallet address.

### How do I get a Sendtag?

You can register a Sendtag during account creation or later in your account settings. Sendtags are unique and first-come, first-served.

### Can I change my Sendtag?

Once registered, Sendtags cannot be changed. Choose your Sendtag carefully as it will be your permanent identifier.

## Troubleshooting

### Why is my transaction pending?

Transactions may take a moment to confirm on the blockchain. If a transaction remains pending for an extended period, check your network connection and try again.

### How do I contact support?

Use the in-app support feature or visit our help center at send.app for assistance.
