# Frequently Asked Questions

Answers to the questions customers most often ask about Send App, the $SEND token, Canton Wallet, and CUSD.

## Send App

### How do I create an account and set up my passkey?
Download Send App or open the web experience at [send.app](https://send.app), choose **Create account**, and register a passkey using Face ID, Touch ID, or a hardware key. The passkey becomes your login credential, so there are no passwords or seed phrases to store.

### What features are available once my wallet is active?
You can send or request transfers, pay invoices, approve Canton Wallet vault actions, participate in rewards programs, and monitor balances across Send App, Canton Wallet, and linked vaults from a single dashboard.

### Can I use the same wallet on multiple devices?
Yes. Add each device as an additional passkey from **Settings → Devices**. Each device enrollment requires biometric confirmation, and you can revoke old devices at any time.

### What happens if I lose a device or need to reset my passkey?
Log in from a backup device or hardware key and remove the missing device from the device list. If all devices are lost, follow the recovery flow to confirm your identity with enrolled backup factors before reissuing a new passkey.

### Are there fees or limits on transfers?
Send covers Canton Network gas, so normal transfers show no gas line item. Network-wide anti-fraud limits may apply; large or unusual transfers can trigger additional verification before completion.

## Send Token ($SEND)

### What utility does $SEND provide?
$SEND powers premium features such as Canton Wallet rewards, staking multipliers, and governance over future product upgrades. Holding or staking $SEND can also unlock higher account limits inside Send App.

### How do I acquire $SEND?
You can buy $SEND on supported exchanges or liquidity pools, then transfer it into your Canton Wallet using the provided deposit address. Inside Send App, select **Add funds → SEND** for step-by-step guidance.

### Are there rewards programs tied to $SEND?
Yes. Qualified wallets can opt into Canton Coin rewards or future staking pools that drip credits based on maintained $SEND balances, as described on the Canton Wallet rewards page.

### What risks should I consider when holding $SEND?
$SEND is a crypto asset and can fluctuate in value. Keep long-term holdings in secure wallets (Canton Wallet or Vault) with multiple passkeys enrolled, and never share private device credentials.

### How can I track my $SEND activity?
Send App displays real-time balances, cost basis, and transaction history. You can also export CSV statements for compliance or plug the address into supported Canton explorers for on-chain verification.

## Canton Wallet

### How do I enroll a Canton Wallet?
Open Send App, navigate to **Canton Wallet**, and follow the onboarding to register at least two passkeys (primary plus backup). The app guides you through linking your Send username to the new wallet.

### Can I connect multiple devices to the same Canton Wallet?
Yes. Use **Wallet Settings → Device management** to add additional passkey devices. Every new device must approve an enrollment request, so you always know who has access.

### What’s the difference between Canton Wallet and Vault?
Canton Wallet is your personal passkey wallet, while Vault is a multisig layer for teams that need approval workflows. Vault accounts live inside Canton Wallet but require a defined quorum for every transfer.

### How do I enable Auto Merge or transfer pre-approval?
Within the Canton Wallet tab, open **Automation settings** to toggle Auto Merge or pre-approval policies. Once enabled, these settings apply during the next rewards drip or transfer cycle.

### Where do I see pending approvals and activity?
The Canton Wallet dashboard includes sections for **Pending actions**, **Completed transfers**, and **Vault proposals**, letting you review every approval, signer, and timestamp in one place.

## CUSD

### What is CUSD?
CUSD (Canton USD) is a digital dollar issued on Canton Network, designed to stay fully backed by cash or cash-equivalent reserves while providing instant settlement inside the Send ecosystem.

### How do I convert assets into CUSD or redeem back to fiat?
In Send App, choose **Add funds → CUSD** to deposit supported stablecoins or fiat rails, then mint CUSD directly into your wallet. To redeem, select **Withdraw → CUSD** and follow the prompts to receive fiat or bridged stablecoins.

### Are there fees or minimums for minting and burning CUSD?
Minting and redeeming through Send App includes a small spread that covers settlement and compliance costs. Minimum transactions are displayed in the form and adjust based on liquidity conditions.

### Where can I use CUSD?
Use CUSD for everyday transfers in Send App, settle invoices between Canton Wallets, fund vault proposals, or spend with merchants that accept Canton Network payments. Support for additional DeFi venues is rolling out alongside new bridges.

### How do I verify that CUSD is fully backed?
Send publishes reserve attestations and supply data on the CUSD page, and Canton explorers let you confirm circulating supply. Compare those figures to the latest attestation to verify parity.
