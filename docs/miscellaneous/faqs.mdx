# Frequently Asked Questions

Answers to the questions customers most often ask about Send App, the $SEND token, Canton Wallet, and CUSD.

## Send App

### How do I create an account and set up my passkey?
Go to send.app and choose Create account, then register a passkey using Face ID, Touch ID, or a hardware key. The passkey becomes your login credential, so there are no passwords or seed phrases to store. iOS and Android apps will be available soon.

### What features are available once my account is active?
You can send and receive money, deposit to a savings vault and earn interest, invest in crypto assets including $SEND token, and participate in our rewards program. Digital bank accounts and cards coming soon.

### Are there fees or limits on sending money?
Currently we charge 1 cent per transaction plus gas costs. Soon all transactions will be free on Send.

### Can I use the same wallet on multiple devices?
Yes. To add a device, go to Settings > Passkeys and add a passkey from the additional device. You'll need to confirm the new passkey using your already approved passkey. Without this approval, you won't be able to execute any transactions on the new device.

### What happens if I lose a device or need to reset my passkey?
Send is non-custodial, which means we don't have access to your account or passkeys. If you lose a device, you can log in from another device where you've backed up your passkey. It's important to back up your passkeys to multiple devices, use a password manager, or save your passkey to the cloud. Without a backup, you cannot recover your account.

## Send Token ($SEND)

### What utility does $SEND provide?
Earn $SEND tokens simply by using Send. These tokens represent direct ownership in the project while unlocking exclusive opportunities and early product access—making $SEND your gateway to the entire ecosystem.

### How do I acquire $SEND?
Buy $SEND in send.app with USDC. Add money using Apple Pay or your debit card, then swap for $SEND. Coming soon: buy $SEND directly with CUSD in Privat.

### Are there rewards programs tied to $SEND?
Yes. When you hold $SEND, you unlock enhanced rewards across all Send products. Active users earn more, and your tokens multiply the benefits you receive from our ecosystem.

### What risks should I consider when holding $SEND?
$SEND is a crypto asset and can fluctuate in value. Keep long-term holdings in Send or Privat Safe using secure passkeys that are backed up to multiple devices. Never share your device credentials or passkeys with anyone.

### How can I track my $SEND activity?
