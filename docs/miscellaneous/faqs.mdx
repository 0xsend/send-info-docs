# Frequently Asked Questions

Answers to the questions customers most often ask about Send App, the $SEND token, Canton Wallet, and CUSD.

## Send App

### How do I create an account and set up my passkey?
Go to send.app and choose Create account, then register a passkey using Face ID, Touch ID, or a hardware key. The passkey becomes your login credential, so there are no passwords or seed phrases to store. iOS and Android apps will be available soon.

### What features are available once my account is active?
You can send and receive money, deposit to a savings vault and earn interest, invest in crypto assets including $SEND token, and participate in our rewards program. Digital bank accounts and cards coming soon.

### Are there fees or limits on sending money?
Currently we charge 1 cent per transaction plus gas costs. Soon all transactions will be free on Send.

### Can I use the same wallet on multiple devices?
Yes. To add a device, go to Settings > Passkeys and add a passkey from the additional device. You'll need to confirm the new passkey using your already approved passkey. Without this approval, you won't be able to execute any transactions on the new device.

### What happens if I lose a device or need to reset my passkey?
Send is non-custodial, which means we don't have access to your account or passkeys. If you lose a device, you can log in from another device where you've backed up your passkey. It's important to back up your passkeys to multiple devices, use a password manager, or save your passkey to the cloud. Without a backup, you cannot recover your account.

## Send Token ($SEND)

### What utility does $SEND provide?
$SEND powers premium features such as Canton Wallet rewards, staking multipliers, and governance over future product upgrades. Holding or staking $SEND can also unlock higher account limits inside Send App.

### How do I acquire $SEND?
You can buy $SEND on supported exchanges or liquidity pools, then transfer it into your Canton Wallet using the provided deposit address. Inside Send App, select **Add funds → SEND** for step-by-step guidance.

### Are there rewards programs tied to $SEND?
Yes. Qualified wallets can opt into Canton Coin rewards or future staking pools that drip credits based on maintained $SEND balances, as described on the Canton Wallet rewards page.

### What risks should I consider when holding $SEND?
$SEND is a crypto asset and can fluctuate in value. Keep long-term holdings in secure wallets (Canton Wallet or Vault) with multiple passkeys enrolled, and never share private device credentials.

### How can I track my $SEND activity?
Send App displays real-time balances, cost basis, and transaction history. You can also export CSV statements for compliance or plug the address into supported Canton explorers for on-chain verification.

## Canton Wallet

### How do I enroll a Canton Wallet?
Open Send App, navigate to **Canton Wallet**, and follow the onboarding to register at least two passkeys (primary plus backup). The app guides you through linking your Send username to the new wallet.

### Can I connect multiple devices to the same Canton Wallet?
Yes. Use **Wallet Settings → Device management** to add additional passkey devices. Every new device must approve an enrollment request, so you always know who has access.

### What’s the difference between Canton Wallet and Vault?
Canton Wallet is your personal passkey wallet, while Vault is a multisig layer for teams that need approval workflows. Vault accounts live inside Canton Wallet but require a defined quorum for every transfer.

### How do I enable Auto Merge or transfer pre-approval?
Within the Canton Wallet tab, open **Automation settings** to toggle Auto Merge or pre-approval policies. Once enabled, these settings apply during the next rewards drip or transfer cycle.

### Where do I see pending approvals and activity?
The Canton Wallet dashboard includes sections for **Pending actions**, **Completed transfers**, and **Vault proposals**, letting you review every approval, signer, and timestamp in one place.

## CUSD

### What is CUSD?
CUSD (Canton USD) is a digital dollar issued on Canton Network, designed to stay fully backed by cash or cash-equivalent reserves while providing instant settlement inside the Send ecosystem.

### How do I convert assets into CUSD or redeem back to fiat?
In Send App, choose **Add funds → CUSD** to deposit supported stablecoins or fiat rails, then mint CUSD directly into your wallet. To redeem, select **Withdraw → CUSD** and follow the prompts to receive fiat or bridged stablecoins.

### Are there fees or minimums for minting and burning CUSD?
Minting and redeeming through Send App includes a small spread that covers settlement and compliance costs. Minimum transactions are displayed in the form and adjust based on liquidity conditions.

### Where can I use CUSD?
Use CUSD for everyday transfers in Send App, settle invoices between Canton Wallets, fund vault proposals, or spend with merchants that accept Canton Network payments. Support for additional DeFi venues is rolling out alongside new bridges.

### How do I verify that CUSD is fully backed?
Send publishes reserve attestations and supply data on the CUSD page, and Canton explorers let you confirm circulating supply. Compare those figures to the latest attestation to verify parity.
