# Glossary

Key terms and phrases used throughout the Send documentation.

## Privacy-First
Design philosophy where confidentiality and data minimization are embedded as default behaviors rather than optional add-ons. For Send, this means transaction data, account metadata, and identity information are handled with encryption, selective disclosure, and strict access controls.

## Non-Custodial
A system in which users retain direct ownership and control over their assets. Send wallets maintain user control through smart contracts and passkey-secured authentication instead of relying on third-party custody.

## Progressive Web App (PWA)
Web applications that deliver app-like experiences, including offline support and home screen installation, while running inside standard browsers. Send's web experience at [send.app](https://send.app) is deployed as a PWA.

## Stablecoin
A digital asset designed to maintain a stable value relative to a reference currency. Send currently supports USDC and is developing CUSD, a privacy-forward stablecoin native to the Canton Network.

## Smart Contract
Self-executing code deployed on a blockchain that enforces business logic without intermediaries. Send leverages smart contracts for account abstraction, payments, and yield programs.

## Sendtag
A human-readable username that maps to a Send wallet address, enabling payments without sharing long hexadecimal strings. Sendtags simplify payments across both the Send app and partner experiences.

## Token Upgrade
The January 2025 migration that reduced the legacy SEND supply from 100 billion to 1 billion tokens. Holders of the v0 token completed an on-chain conversion to align with the new supply mechanics.

## Yield Program
Any structured offering inside Send that allows users to earn passive returns on assets such as USDC or, in the future, CUSD. Yield programs are governed by smart contracts with transparent parameters.
