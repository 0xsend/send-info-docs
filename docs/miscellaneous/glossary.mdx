# Glossary

Key terms and phrases used throughout the Send documentation.

## Privacy-First
Design philosophy where confidentiality and data minimization are embedded as default behaviors rather than optional add-ons. For Send, this means transaction data, account metadata, and identity information are handled with encryption, selective disclosure, and strict access controls.

## Non-Custodial
A system in which users retain direct ownership and control over their assets. Send wallets maintain user control through smart contracts and passkey-secured authentication instead of relying on third-party custody.

## Progressive Web App (PWA)
Web applications that deliver app-like experiences, including offline support and home screen installation, while running inside standard browsers. Send's web experience at [send.app](https://send.app) is deployed as a PWA.

## Send
The privacy-first payments company building programmable money and identity tools on Canton Network. For a broader overview of the mission and team, see [Send Overview](../welcome/send-overview) and [Team](../welcome/team).

## $SEND
The ERC-20 utility and governance token for the Send ecosystem, issued on Base and used for incentives, protocol alignment, and treasury programs. Historical supply changes are detailed in the [$SEND Token Upgrade](../send-token/upgrade).

## Stablecoin
A digital asset designed to maintain a stable value relative to a reference currency. Send currently supports $USDC and is developing $CUSD, a privacy-first stablecoin native to the Canton Network.

## Smart Contract
Self-executing code deployed on a blockchain that enforces business logic without intermediaries. Send leverages smart contracts for account abstraction, payments, and yield programs.

## Sendtag
A human-readable username that maps to a Send wallet address, enabling payments without sharing long hexadecimal strings. Sendtags simplify payments across both the Send app and partner experiences.

## Token Upgrade
The January 2025 migration that reduced the legacy $SEND supply from 100 billion to 1 billion tokens. Holders of the v0 token completed an on-chain conversion to align with the new supply mechanics.

## Yield Program
Any structured offering inside Send that allows users to earn passive returns on assets such as $USDC or, in the future, $CUSD. Yield programs are governed by smart contracts with transparent parameters.
