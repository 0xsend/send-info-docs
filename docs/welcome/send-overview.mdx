# Send: Global Money, Private by Design

Send is a fintech platform that allows anyone, anywhere to send, save, and earn on their money privately using just a smartphone. Built on the Canton Network, it combines global access with privacy-first blockchain infrastructure.

## What We Do

* Input: A smartphone and an internet connection.
* Output: Instant cross-border payments, stablecoin savings, and access to financial services.
* How: The Canton Network's privacy-preserving blockchain keeps transactions confidential while connecting users to the global economy.

## Why It Matters

* 1.4 billion people are excluded from traditional banking due to high fees, complex rules, or lack of access. Send removes these barriers.
* Privacy is non-negotiable. Unlike public blockchains, Canton hides transaction details by default, protecting you from surveillance while meeting regulatory needs.

## What You Get

* Send Mobile App: Send money across borders instantly, save in stablecoins, and access DeFiâ€”no bank account required.
* Canton Wallet: Secure, private wallet for advanced financial tools.
* CUSD Stablecoin: A privacy-first currency for everyday and enterprise use.

## Why We Are Different

Traditional finance forces a choice: access or privacy. Send delivers both. Whether you are an individual seeking financial freedom or a business that needs confidential transactions, Send works for you.

:::tip Privacy as a Default Setting
Global reach and regulatory alignment are built around user sovereignty, not the other way around. Send treats privacy as the baseline expectation for modern financial services.
