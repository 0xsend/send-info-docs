# Send: Global Money, Private by Design

Send is building the future of money where payments are instant, access is seamless, and privacy is non-negotiable. The platform lets anyone, anywhere send, save, and earn with just a smartphone. Today, Send combines Base for mainstream reach with the privacy-first Canton Network so the experience stays fast while the ecosystem transitions toward fully private finance.

## What We Do

* **Input:** A smartphone and an internet connection.
* **Output:** Instant cross-border payments, stablecoin savings, and access to privacy-preserving financial services.
* **How:** Base powers high-speed transfers today while the Canton Network keeps sensitive activity confidential—paving the way for a privacy-by-default experience across the product line.

## Why It Matters

* 1.4 billion people are excluded from traditional banking due to high fees, complex rules, or lack of access. Send removes these barriers with intuitive, mobile-first tools.
* Privacy is non-negotiable. Send pairs the compliance-ready privacy of Canton with transparent Base rails until the Send App graduates fully onto private infrastructure, giving you control without sacrificing usability.

## What You Get

* Send Mobile App: Built on Base for speed today and evolving toward Canton-backed privacy. Move money instantly, save in stablecoins, and tap rewards—no bank account required.
* Canton Wallet: A privacy-first wallet on Canton Network with biometric passkeys that keeps transactions confidential by default.
* SEND Token: The engine of the Send ecosystem, rewarding participation, unlocking features, and funding growth of privacy-first finance.
* CUSD Stablecoin: A privacy-first currency that blends everyday utility with regulatory readiness for individuals and enterprises alike.

## Why We Are Different

Traditional finance forces a choice: access or privacy. Send stitches Base and Canton together so you get both—speed for everyday adoption, and private rails when confidentiality matters most. Whether you are an individual seeking financial freedom or a business that needs confidential transactions, Send is built to meet you where you are and protect where you’re going.

:::tip Privacy as a Default Setting
Global reach and regulatory alignment are built around user sovereignty. Canton Wallet already delivers fully private transfers, and the Send App is charting the same path so privacy remains the baseline expectation for modern financial services.
