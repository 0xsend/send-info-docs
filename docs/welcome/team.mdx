# Team

Send is built by operators, engineers, and designers who have shipped production systems at scale and care about practical privacy. Each lead owns a clear mandate while collaborating across functions to keep the product fast, compliant, and delightful.

## Leadership

### **Allen Eubank - Founding CTO**
Polyglot programmer and systems architect with deep experience in product development and infrastructure. Allen led engineering at AdLibertas through an acquisition, shipping ad waterfall optimization and predictive LTV pipelines. Before Send, he helped launch SendNodes, building the POKT Wallet browser extension and staking platform. At Send, he directs R&D around self-sovereign control of digital assets and identities across JavaScript, Ruby, Python, Java, Kotlin, Go, and Ethereum stacks. His perspective is straightforward: "We can build anything we want given enough time."

### **Ethen Eric - Founding CEO**
Oversees finance, token design, and product strategy. Passionate about decentralized finance and committed to expanding practical access to stable money.

### **Bill Barth - CFO**
Career finance leader with experience in business analysis, operations, negotiation, value stream mapping, and pricing strategy. Holds an MBA from Loyola Marymount University.

### **Erick Ho - Head of Strategy**
Serial entrepreneur across consumer and infrastructure startups. Erick cofounded blockchain infrastructure companies Nodies and Function, served as a Senior Software Engineer at Coinbase, and advised seed through Series A teams as an AWS Solutions Architect. He is currently an investor and advisor to Send and Mamo.

### **Xino Zee - Africa Lead**

## Engineering

### **Beezy - Founding Engineer, Software Architect, and DevOps Automation Expert**
Brandon Young is a seasoned Software Architect with over 15 years of experience in enterprise healthcare. He excels as a DevOps engineer and Web3 expert, specializing in deploying blockchain solutions, staking, and automating processes across diverse networks, alongside full-stack development.

### **Victor Ginelli - Engineering Full Stack**

### **Musidlo - web3 enthusiast, /dev at Send**
Prototypes new smart-contract flows, maintains core infrastructure, and keeps Send's on-chain integrations humming. Still allergic to overly corporate bios.

### **Alexander - Content Systems Engineer**
Alexander Girardet is a software engineer turned vibe marketer. He specialises in creating end-to-end AI powered content marketing systems.

## Design

### **Rit Sriv - Founding Designer**
Product designer with a thing for clean systems, sharp humor, and ideas that feel effortless. Rit turns complex concepts into visuals that feel obvious in hindsight. Most work lives somewhere between "why did no one do this before?" and "this is kind of absurd, but I love it."

### **Gustas - Designer**
Senior designer with a foundation in graphic design and a sharp focus on branding, visual systems, and digital design. My work blends strategic thinking with strong visual instincts. Over the past 10 years, I've collaborated with clients across industries â€” from early-stage startups to global brands. My role has ranged from brand creation and development to large-scale implementations and European campaigns. This experience across different stages of the branding process has shaped a more holistic, strategic approach to design.

## Marketing

### **Kristel - Professional Shitposter / Marketing**
Translates deep product knowledge into approachable content, community memes, and campaigns that keep the brand human.

### **Stefan - Motion Design / Marketing**
Designs animation systems and launch assets that explain complex mechanics in a few seconds of motion.

## Support

### **Strongmind - Support**
Runs the whole support engine. Handles everything from customer escalations to system design for Intercom, saved replies, article flows, and automation. Bridging real user feedback into product insight. Probably answered your DM before you hit send.
