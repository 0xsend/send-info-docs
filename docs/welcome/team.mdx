# Team

Send is built by operators, engineers, and designers who have shipped production systems at scale and care about practical privacy. Each lead owns a clear mandate while collaborating across functions to keep the product fast, compliant, and delightful.

## Leadership

### **Allen Eubank - Founding CTO**
Polyglot programmer and systems architect with deep experience in product development and infrastructure. Allen led engineering at AdLibertas through an acquisition, shipping ad waterfall optimization and predictive LTV pipelines. Before Send, he helped launch SendNodes, building the POKT Wallet browser extension and staking platform. At Send, he directs R&D around self-sovereign control of digital assets and identities across JavaScript, Ruby, Python, Java, Kotlin, Go, and Ethereum stacks. His perspective is straightforward: "We can build anything we want given enough time."

### **Beezy - Founding Engineer, Software Architect, and DevOps Automation Expert**

## Engineering

### **Musidlo - web3 enthusiast, /dev at Send**

### **Ehsan sarshar - Senior Frontend Developer**

## Design

### **Rit Sriv - Founding Designer**
Product designer with a thing for clean systems, sharp humor, and ideas that feel effortless. Rit turns complex concepts into visuals that feel obvious in hindsight. Most work lives somewhere between "why did no one do this before?" and "this is kind of absurd, but I love it."

### **Gustas - Designer**
Senior designer with a foundation in graphic design and a sharp focus on branding, visual systems, and digital design. My work blends strategic thinking with strong visual instincts. Over the past 10 years, I've collaborated with clients across industries â€” from early-stage startups to global brands. My role has ranged from brand creation and development to large-scale implementations and European campaigns. This experience across different stages of the branding process has shaped a more holistic, strategic approach to design.

## Marketing

### **Kristel - Marketing Advisor**
Translates deep product knowledge into approachable content, community memes, and campaigns that keep the brand human.

## Support

### **Strongmind - Support**
Runs the whole support engine. Handles everything from customer escalations to system design for Intercom, saved replies, article flows, and automation. Bridging real user feedback into product insight. Probably answered your DM before you hit Send.
