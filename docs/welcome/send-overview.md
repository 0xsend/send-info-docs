# Send Overview

Send is a fintech company building the next generation of financial infrastructure that combines global accessibility with privacy-preserving technology. We're creating financial tools that work for everyone, everywhere, while giving users complete control over their money and data.

## Global Financial Access

Traditional banking excludes over 1.4 billion people worldwide through high barriers, complex requirements, and geographic limitations. Send eliminates these obstacles by building on blockchain technology that requires only a smartphone and internet connection to access the global financial system.

Our platform enables anyone to:
- Send money instantly across borders without banking intermediaries
- Save and earn returns on stablecoins without minimum balances
- Access financial services regardless of location or documentation status
- Participate in the digital economy without traditional banking infrastructure

## Privacy by Design

Unlike most blockchain networks where all transactions are publicly visible, Send builds on Canton Network - a privacy-preserving blockchain that keeps transaction details confidential by default. This means your financial activities remain private while still benefiting from blockchain security and global accessibility.

Canton Network's privacy architecture enables:
- Confidential transaction amounts and counterparties
- Selective disclosure for regulatory compliance
- Enterprise-grade privacy for business operations
- Protection from financial surveillance and analysis

## Solving Real Problems

We created Send because the current financial system fails on two critical fronts: it excludes billions of people from basic services, and it operates without privacy protection in an increasingly surveilled world. Traditional solutions force you to choose between access and privacy - Send provides both.

Our ecosystem includes:
- **Send Mobile Apps**: Privacy-first payments and savings accessible globally
- **Canton Wallet**: Advanced wallet for confidential DeFi interactions
- **CUSD Stablecoin**: Privacy-native stablecoin for institutional and retail use

## The Canton Advantage

By building on Canton Network, Send offers something unique in the blockchain space: financial tools that are both globally accessible and privacy-preserving by default. While other blockchain platforms expose all transaction data publicly, Canton's confidential computing architecture protects user privacy without sacrificing the benefits of decentralized finance.

This privacy-first approach combined with global accessibility makes Send suitable for everyone from unbanked individuals seeking financial inclusion to enterprises requiring confidential treasury operations.
