# Problem Statement

The current financial system operates with fundamental design flaws that compromise privacy, exclude billions of people, and create unnecessary friction in our increasingly digital world. Send addresses these core issues through privacy-first financial infrastructure.

## Financial Surveillance and Privacy Erosion

Traditional banking systems expose your complete financial life to surveillance. Every transaction, purchase, and transfer is recorded, analyzed, and stored by banks, payment processors, and government agencies. This data reveals intimate details about your lifestyle, political affiliations, health conditions, and personal relationships.

Your financial privacy is further compromised through:
- Transaction data sold to advertisers and data brokers
- Account freezes and seizures without due process
- Discriminatory lending based on spending patterns
- Corporate espionage through transparent business transactions

This surveillance infrastructure fundamentally alters behavior - people self-censor purchases, avoid legitimate transactions, and lose financial autonomy. Privacy is not about hiding wrongdoing; it is about maintaining dignity and freedom in an increasingly monitored world.

## Custodial Control and Financial Censorship

Banks and payment processors maintain complete control over your money, creating single points of failure that can instantly cut you off from your funds. Account freezes, payment blocks, and service denials affect millions of people annually, often with little recourse or explanation.

This custodial model enables:
- Arbitrary account closures for political or business reasons
- Transaction blocking based on merchant type or geography
- Wealth confiscation through asset forfeiture
- Platform debanking of legitimate businesses

When intermediaries control your money, you do not truly own it. Send's non-custodial approach ensures you maintain complete control over your funds while still accessing modern financial services.

Fractional reserve banking compounds the risk. Many banks are only required to keep a small percentage of deposits liquid—often around ten percent—while the remainder is redeployed or invested elsewhere. In periods of stress, rushed withdrawals can trigger liquidity crises or outright bank runs. Send removes that structural weakness by keeping value in the user's self-custodied wallet. Funds stay liquid unless the owner explicitly puts them to work, and even then smart contracts make positions auditable and instantly recallable.

## Global Financial Exclusion

Over 1.4 billion people worldwide remain excluded from basic financial services, trapped in cash-only economies that limit economic opportunity. Traditional banking requirements - minimum balances, complex documentation, credit histories, and physical branch access - systematically exclude the world's most vulnerable populations.

The unbanked cannot:
- Safely store value or earn returns on savings
- Participate in the global digital economy
- Send or receive international payments efficiently
- Build financial history or access credit

This exclusion perpetuates poverty cycles and limits economic mobility. Send's permissionless access eliminates these barriers, requiring only a smartphone and internet connection to participate in the global financial system.

## Inefficient Cross-Border Payments

International money transfers through traditional banking take 3-5 days, cost up to 7% in fees, and involve complex correspondent banking relationships that exclude many regions entirely. These inefficiencies particularly burden migrant workers sending remittances home, small businesses engaging in international trade, and anyone needing rapid cross-border value transfer.

The current system's friction stems from:
- Multiple intermediary banks adding costs and delays
- Regulatory compliance requirements varying by jurisdiction
- Limited banking hours and processing windows
- Opacity in fees and exchange rates

Send enables instant, global transfers at minimal cost, eliminating the correspondent banking bottleneck while maintaining regulatory compliance through privacy-preserving mechanisms.

## The Privacy Infrastructure Gap

No major financial platform prioritizes privacy by design. Every existing solution treats privacy as an afterthought, retrofit, or premium feature rather than a fundamental right. This creates a market opportunity for privacy-native financial infrastructure that does not compromise on functionality or compliance.

Send fills this gap by building financial tools that are private by default, globally accessible, and aligned with user sovereignty rather than surveillance capitalism.
