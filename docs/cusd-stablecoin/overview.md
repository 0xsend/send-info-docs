# CUSD Stablecoin Overview

**CUSD ($CUSD) - Privacy-Native Stablecoin**

CUSD is redefining what a stablecoin can be: private, programmable, and built for real-world use.

## Executive Summary

CUSD ($CUSD) is a USD-pegged stablecoin launched on Canton Network via Brale, designed for privacy-native transactions across institutional and retail use cases. CUSD enables confidential transactions by default while maintaining full regulatory compliance and 1:1 USD backing.

The protocol generates sustainable value through treasury yield management (~4% annually), with 80% directed to $SEND buybacks and 20% supporting operations. Users earn $CC rewards from Canton Network activity, creating a flywheel where $CUSD adoption drives ecosystem engagement across Send's ecosystem of products - Canton Wallet, Canton Safe, and Send mobile apps. Target metrics include $50M TVL in Year 1, achieved through GENIUS Act compliance and privacy-preserving institutional onboarding.

### Key Value Propositions

- Privacy-native transactions with selective compliance disclosure
- Direct $SEND value accrual through automated buybacks (80% of yield)
- $CC rewards integration across Canton Network applications
- Enterprise-grade self-custody and regulatory framework

## Privacy Architecture

### Why Privacy Matters for Stablecoins

Current stablecoins operate with full transaction transparency, creating fundamental vulnerabilities:

- **Enterprise Risk**: Competitors analyze cash flows, supplier relationships, and strategic positioning
- **Individual Exposure**: DeFi participants reveal net worth, trading strategies, and financial behavior
- **Security Concerns**: Large holders become targets for attacks and social engineering
- **Commercial Disadvantage**: Transparent balances weaken negotiating positions

### Canton Network Privacy Solution

CUSD leverages Canton's confidential computing architecture:

- **Private Transactions**: Amounts and counterparties remain confidential between participants
- **Selective Disclosure**: Compliance reporting through privacy-preserving mechanisms
- **Zero-Knowledge Attestation**: Reserve backing verification without exposing specific positions
- **Institutional Privacy**: Enterprise treasury operations without strategic information leakage

## Compliance and Regulation

CUSD prioritizes privacy-preserving compliance across multiple jurisdictions, utilizing Brale's regulated issuance platform while maintaining transaction confidentiality through selective disclosure rather than blanket transparency.

### United States Framework

- **Licensing**: Full MTLs across all states as FinCEN-registered MSB
- **Custody**: Bankruptcy-protected accounts with federal OCC trust charter pursuit
- **Compliance**: GENIUS Act alignment through zero-knowledge reserve attestations
- **Auditing**: Monthly independent verification with privacy-preserving reporting

### Global Expansion Strategy

- **European Union**: MiCA compliance via VASP registration, transitioning to CASP/EMI
- **Asia-Pacific**: Singapore (MAS) and Abu Dhabi (FSRA) licenses for institutional adoption
- **Emerging Markets**: Regulated subsidiaries in key growth corridors (Brazil, Mexico, Philippines)

**Regulatory Innovation**: $CC rewards for compliant mints/redemptions incentivize proper KYC while maintaining ongoing transaction privacy.

## Reserves

CUSD maintains 1:1 USD backing through diversified, institutional-grade assets generating sustainable yield while ensuring stability and immediate liquidity.

### Asset Composition

- Short-dated U.S. Treasuries (primary yield generation ~4-5%)
- Overnight Reverse Repo (additional yield with minimal risk)
- Cash Equivalents (liquidity buffer for redemption demands)

### Custody and Verification

Reserve management utilizes partners with $49T+ AUM capacity, holding assets in segregated, bankruptcy-remote accounts. Privacy-preserving proof-of-reserves enables regulatory transparency without exposing specific positions or exact re
