# CUSD Stablecoin Overview

**CUSD ($CUSD) - Privacy-First Stablecoin**

*CUSD redefines what a stablecoin can be: private, programmable, and safe for real-world use.*

## Executive Summary

Send offers CUSD ($CUSD), a USD-pegged stablecoin, on Canton Network via Brale for privacy-first transactions across institutional and retail use cases. CUSD enables confidential transactions by default while maintaining full regulatory compliance and 1:1 USD backing through Frax $frxUSD.

The protocol generates sustainable value through treasury yield management (~4% annually) and additional Frax incentives, with 100% directed to $CC buybacks after Brale's management fee. Users earn $CC rewards from Canton Network activity, creating a flywheel where $CUSD adoption drives engagement across Canton's ecosystem of products.

### Key Value Propositions

- Privacy-first, safety-forward transactions with selective compliance disclosure
- Direct $CC value accrual through automated buybacks (100% of yield)
- '$CC rewards' integration across Canton Network applications
- Enterprise-grade self-custody and regulatory framework

## Partnership Structure

**Send Distribution**: As the product owner of CUSD, Send will make CUSD the primary stablecoin to use on its app and own its distribution throughout Canton.

**Brale Issuance & Compliance**: Brale provides regulated native issuance and monitoring.

**Frax Reserve Backing**: CUSD backed 100% with Frax USD (frxUSD)—a GENIUS-aligned, fully-backed reserve with instant liquidity. frxUSD reserves are held 1:1 against USD assets through institutional-grade, tokenized money-market funds from BlackRock, Fidelity, WisdomTree, Superstate.

**Reward Economics**: Baseline reserve economics from short-duration U.S. Treasuries are passed through in full to fund $CC buybacks. Additional rewards provided by Frax will be provided to further fuel CUSD growth.

**Canton Alignment**: Capital-efficient reserves + rewards make CUSD the most Canton-aligned stablecoin to hold across the network's apps and institutions.

**Targets**: $1B TVL in Year 1 via privacy-preserving institutional onboarding, deep liquidity, and aligned economics.

## Rewards & Economics

**Baseline pass-through**: Short-duration U.S. Treasury reserve economics, via frxUSD, route on-chain to support $CC buybacks.

**Adoption-aligned incentives**: Frax's capital-efficient infrastructure enables additional, programmatic incentives that may be activated as CUSD adoption scales on Canton.

**Canton alignment**: The combined Send×Brale×Frax structure concentrates value back into the Canton ecosystem, reinforcing CUSD as the default stable asset to hold.
