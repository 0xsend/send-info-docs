# CUSD FAQs

## What is CUSD?

CUSD is a privacy-first, USD-backed stablecoin created by Send, issued by Brale, and backed 1:1 with Frax's frxUSD. "Privacy-first" means the system is designed so that privacy is the default, while still supporting compliance when needed.

## What are CUSD's core privacy features?

- Confidential transfers (transaction amounts and counterparties are private)
- Selective disclosure (you can share information with auditors or regulators when required)
- Privacy-preserving API access (integrations maintain confidentiality)

## Who is responsible for CUSD (Send, Brale, Frax), and what does each partner do?

- **Send**: Product owner and distributor; integrates CUSD across its apps.
- **Brale**: Regulated issuer; handles compliance, monitoring, and mint/redeem.
- **Frax**: Provides frxUSD reserves that back CUSD 1:1.

## What backs CUSD, and how is the peg maintained?

CUSD is backed entirely by frxUSD, which is fully backed by USD-denominated, tokenized money-market funds. The peg is supported through 1:1 collateral, liquidity, and programmatic mint/redeem.

## Is CUSD fully collateralized? How do I know reserves are real?

Yes. CUSD is fully collateralized by frxUSD.  frxUSD is backed 1:1 by tokenized U.S. money-market funds from institutional providers.

## What makes CUSD privacy-first, and how do confidential transfers work?

CUSD supports confidential transfers (amounts and counterparties are private) and selective disclosure for compliance when needed.

## How do I get, hold, or use CUSD as a retail user?

You can hold, send, and use CUSD inside the Canton Wallet (Send app). More access points will be added as integrations expand.

## What can I do with CUSD inside the Send ecosystem?

- Send App: Hold and transfer privately
- Send Safe: Enterprise multi-sig storage
- Pool Party: Confidential AMM swaps
- More integrations will be added as products roll out.

## Does CUSD generate rewards or value accrual?

Yes. All reserve economics attributable to CUSD (after Brale's 10% management fee) accrue to the CUSD Treasury and are used to buy back $CC, the native asset of the Canton Network ecosystem.

## Does Frax provide additional incentives?

Yes. Frax provides TVL milestone rewards to support CUSD growth.

## When do $CC buy backs happen?

$CC buy backs occur 4 times per month on the 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th.

## How frequently are reserves reported or attested?

Reserves are reported monthly. A revenue report is generated by Brale and uploaded to the [Reserves Report](./reserves-report) page.

## Can CUSD be integrated into other apps, wallets, or financial systems?

Yes. Integrations can be done through Brale’s issuance APIs and Send’s programmatic APIs.
