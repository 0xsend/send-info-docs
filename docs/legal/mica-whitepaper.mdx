Send It's technology infrastructure is built on Vercel, Expo EAS, and Docker/Kubernetes, ensuring scalable and resilient deployment. The open-source codebase is publicly available at https://github.com/0xsend/sendapp, reinforcing transparency and community collaboration.

The project has implemented WebAuthn/FIDO2 biometric authentication, device secure enclave key management, and no server-side custody of user credentials. Data is protected through TLS 1.3 encryption in transit, encryption at rest, and PostgreSQL Row-Level Security, complemented by smart contract role-based access controls and comprehensive audit logging.

The platform offers advanced product features such as passkey-based authentication, tag-based transfers, referral rewards, and savings functionalities that deliver SEND token incentives.

## Part F - Information about the Crypto-Assets

**F.1: Other token type**
SEND is a crypto-asset as defined under MiCAR, which is not an "e-money token", "an asset-referenced token" or a "utility token", each as defined under MiCAR. Therefore, it falls in the "Other" category

**F.2: Other token functionality**
Rewards Qualification
Holding the SEND token enables participation in distribution pools and eligibility to earn rewards. Verified holders who meet specific activity and holding criteria may receive token-based incentives tied to ecosystem engagement.

Transaction Fee Discounts
Within the Send ecosystem, SEND holders benefit from reduced transaction fees, encouraging active participation and on-platform circulation of the token.

Liquidity Provision
SEND can be utilized to provide liquidity on decentralized exchanges. Participants supplying liquidity may earn trading fees and potentially qualify for ecosystem-based incentives, contributing to the token's overall market depth and usability.

Ecosystem Access
Ownership of SEND grants users access to premium features and early access to new products or services within the Send ecosystem. This utility supports the token's role as a participation and access mechanism within the network.

Staking (Future Utility)
A planned feature, referred to as Canton Coin Staking (stCC), is expected to introduce a staking mechanism, enabling users to lock $CC for additional rewards or benefits within the platform.

Collateral (Future Utility)
Future integrations may allow SEND to be used as collateral in DeFi protocols, expanding its utility beyond the Send platform into broader Web3 financial applications.

Payment Method (Future Utility)
SEND is intended to evolve into a native medium of exchange for services and transactions within the Send ecosystem, facilitating seamless on-platform payments and transfers.

**F.3: Planned application of functionalities**
No specific future-dated timeline for SEND token functionalities (such as staking, governance, new exchange listings, or airdrops) has been announced as of November 2025. The following token-related functionalities are planned, but without announced go-live dates:

- Canton Coin Staking ($stCC): Described as an upcoming staking mechanism, but no launch date is given.
- Governance: Potential future DAO participation is referenced, but it is not currently active and no activation date is provided.
- Vesting: Team and contributor tokens continue monthly vesting, with projections for additional tokens to be released over the next 12 months, but without specific unlock dates beyond the general schedule.

Holders of $SEND tokens automatically benefit from reduced transaction fees when conducting activities within the Send ecosystem, including sending funds or engaging with Send app features. No manual activation or claim process is required; the applicable discounts are applied seamlessly by the system during qualifying transactions, provided the user's wallet holds the required token balance.

Ecosystem Access: Premium Features and Early Access
Users holding $SEND tokens may gain access to premium ecosystem features and early product releases. To exercise this right, holders must access the Send app via https://send.app/, connect their wallet or create an account using the platform's passkey authentication system, and maintain a qualifying balance of $SEND.

## Part H - Information on the underlying technology

**H.1: Distributed ledger technology (DTL)**

This applies across features including savings and trading interfaces exposed in the app. Accounts access leverage WebAuthn passkeys (biometrics/device secrets) instead of passwords or seed phrases for the consumer apps. This improves authentication UX while keeping private keys under user/device control. Sendtags provide app-level identifiers that map to user accounts, simplifying transfers relative to raw wallet addresses.

Payments Rails and On-Chain Integrations
The app supports USDC transfers and a non-custodial Savings vault that routes deposits to audited, established DeFi lending protocols (e.g., Moonwell, Morpho) with risk controls and real-time tracking.

Privacy Layer and Selective Disclosure (Canton)
On Canton, transaction details are private by default with selective compliance disclosure. The CUSD design notes privacy-preserving attestations, institutional custody posture, and automated buyback mechanics executed on Canton-aligned infrastructure.

App Delivery
The primary client today is a PWA at send.app, with native iOS/Android apps "in development." This clarifies the interface layer by which users interact with the underlying ledgers.

**H.2: Protocols and technical standards**
Protocols and Standards Used in Project Send It (Token: SEND):
Layer 2 and Base Network:
Send operates on the Base network, which is an Ethereum Layer 2 built on the OP Stack. This provides scalability through faster block times (~2 seconds) and reduced gas fees.

Token Standard:
The SEND token is implemented as an ERC-20 token on the Base network.

Account Abstraction and Smart Wallets:
Send uses account abstraction compliant with ERC-4337 and EIP-7677, enabling smart wallets (Send accounts) with features such as gasless transactions via a paymaster contract and biometric authentication (WebAuthn, P-256 signature verification through SendVerifier contract).

Privacy Layer:
A privacy layer is provided through the Canton Network, which supports confidential transactions and operates with its own validator set. This adds privacy and interoperability features beyond the EVM.

Wallets, SDKs, and Frontend:
The project uses a non-custodial smart wallet architecture. The frontend is built with Next.js (web) and React Native (mobile, Expo). SDKs and libraries referenced in the codebase include viem and wagmi for blockchain interactions, and WebAuthn for biometric authentication. The backend uses Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Realtime), and blockchain event indexing is handled by Shovel.

Interoperability and Scalability Focus:

- Interoperability is achieved through the use of the Base (OP Stack) L2, ERC-4337 account abstraction, and integration with the Canton Network for privacy/confidentiality.
- Scalability is addressed by leveraging the Base network's fast block times and low fees, as well as account abstraction for efficient transaction management.

**H.3: Technology used**
Send operates on a non-custodial architecture, ensuring that users retain full control over their crypto-assets at all times. The platform does not engage in server-side custody, and there are no mandatory KYC/AML requirements for wallet use.

The primary wallet type is a mobile-first smart wallet built on the Base network. It leverages the ERC-4337 account abstraction standard, enabling smart contract-based wallets with enhanced flexibility and automation. For user authentication and key management, the wallet integrates biometric security through WebAuthn/FIDO2 passkeys, which are stored securely within device secure enclaves, ensuring that private keys never leave the user's device.

Future upgrades include the introduction of multisignature "Vaults" for enhanced user wallet security, while treasury operations already employ a 4-of-7 multisignature scheme, providing distributed control and oversight by the Send Council.

**H.4: Consensus mechanism**
Consensus for the Send project (token: SEND) is based on the Base network, which is an Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) solution. Base operates as an optimistic rollup, meaning transactions are processed off-chain for efficiency and then posted to Ethereum Layer 1, which uses Proof of Stake (PoS) for final settlement. This structure allows for fast (~2 second block times) and low-cost transactions while inheriting the security guarantees of Ethereum's PoS consensus.

For privacy, Send It integrates the Canton Network as a privacy layer, which currently runs with 2 validators and provides confidential transactions by default. The Canton Network is a permissioned system, so its security relies on the integrity and operation of its validators.

Security and efficiency are achieved by:

- Leveraging Base's optimistic rollup, which batches many transactions and posts them to Ethereum, reducing fees and increasing throughput while relying on Ethereum's robust PoS security for finality.
- Using the Canton Network for privacy, which ensures confidential transactions but depends on a smaller, permissioned validator set for its own consensus.

**H.5: Incentive mechanisms and applicable fees**
On Base network, SEND is an ERC-20 token which inherits security of Ethereum via Base's architecture. Because consensus security is provided by the L2/L1 stack, Send does not require a native incentive mechanism to secure transactions. On Canton, the transactions are secured through a permissioned validator set, so its security relies on the integrity and operation of its validators.

**H.6: Use of distributed ledger technology**
False

**H.7: DLT functionality description**
Not applicable

**H.8: Audit**
False

**H.9: Audit outcome**

## Part I - Information on Risks

**I.1: Offer-related risks**
Tokenomics/Vesting Risk:
SEND has a fixed supply of 1 billion tokens, with a significant portion subject to vesting schedules for team, contributors, and rewards. As of September 2025, only about 31.5% of tokens are in circulation, with the remainder to be released over time. The foundation expects the release of 22 - 25 million in additional tokens over the next 12 months through team and contributor unlocks. Large future unlocks or treasury allocations could impact token price and market dynamics. Vesting and distribution are enforced on-chain, but concentrated allocations may still pose dilution risks.

Market/Liquidity Risk:
As with most crypto-assets, SEND is subject to significant price volatility. Crypto-assets could also be susceptible to low liquidity especially during times of high volatility.

Security Risk
The SEND contract has not yet undergone a security audit and may therefore pose additional risks, including potential vulnerabilities to malicious attacks that could lead to security breaches or loss of funds.

Legal/Regulatory Risk:
Send Foundation is in compliance with Cook Islands law and MiCA token structure, but regulatory requirements may vary by jurisdiction. There is a risk that future regulatory changes or interpretations could impact the token's status or restrict its use or trading.

Operational Risk:
The SEND token is an ERC-20 token on the Base network. Technical risks include potential vulnerabilities in smart contracts, the underlying Base blockchain, and the app's security architecture.

Governance/Centralization Risk:
Foundation governance is managed by a council of four, with major decisions requiring a 3-of-4 majority. Treasury operations use a 4-of-7 multisig. While these controls provide oversight, decision-making remains relatively centralized, and changes to operational or strategic direction could be made by a small group. As of November 2025, there are no governance rights attached to the SEND token itself.

**I.2: Issuer-related risks**
Financial Health

As with any commercial venture, there is a risk of insolvency, which could result from factors including, but not limited to, the failure of the project, lack of adoption, or force majeure events.

Nature and Stability of Business Activities

The project's operational model relies on ongoing user adoption of its app, as well as the continued liquidity and utility of the $SEND token. Failure of the token to achieve broad adoption could threaten the project's long-term sustainability.

Industry Risks

The Foundation operates in the digital payments and privacy-focused fintech sector, which is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change. There is uncertainty regarding the adoption and sustainability of the technology which could present additional risk to the project.

Legal and Regulatory Compliance Challenges

The Issuer and its parent entity are registered in offshore jurisdictions (Cook Islands), which may present challenges in terms of regulatory oversight and legal recourse. The regulatory status of the protocol and DAO remains unsettled in many jurisdictions. This creates potential legal and compliance risks for investors, including the risk of future regulatory actions or restrictions on token transferability and trading).

**I.3: Other tokens-related risks**
Tokenomics/Vesting Risk
SEND has a fixed supply of 1 billion tokens, with a significant portion subject to vesting schedules for team, contributors, and rewards. As of September 2025, only about 31.5% of tokens are in circulation, with the remainder to be released over time. The foundation expects the release of 22 - 25 million in additional tokens over the next 12 months through team and contributor unlocks. Large future unlocks or treasury allocations could impact token price and market dynamics. Vesting and distribution are enforced on-chain, but concentrated allocations may still pose dilution risks.

Speculative Asset risk

Like most cryptocurrencies, SEND lacks intrinsic value. The token is not backed by any real-world asset, and its price is primarily driven by speculation surrounding the asset and its underlying network. This speculative nature could lead to significant volatility and potential loss of value.

Market/Liquidity Risk
As with most crypto-assets, SEND is subject to significant price volatility. Crypto-assets could also be susceptible to low liquidity especially during times of high volatility.

Regulatory risk

As cryptocurrencies represent a relatively new asset class, the regulatory landscape remains uncertain and continues to evolve. Future regulatory changes could adversely affect the token, its underlying network, or its holders.

Technical/Security Risks

The platform relies on Base (Ethereum Layer 2) and the Canton Network for privacy, with only two validators currently running. Risks include smart contract vulnerabilities, cross-chain bridge risks, and dependency on third-party infrastructure providers..

Governance Risks

Treasury operations require 4-of-7 multisig approval, and a Foundation Council oversees major distributions. Risks include council member availability, disagreements, and multisig signer coordination.

**I.4: Project implementation-related risks**
Technical Risks
Send faces potential smart contract vulnerabilities, which are mitigated through audits and open-source review. There are also risks associated with cross-chain bridges between the Base and Canton networks, as well as dependencies on third-party infrastructure providers such as Supabase, Vercel, Expo, and Temporal.

Operational/Resource Risks
Resource constraints and coordination issues among team members are not explicitly detailed, but the project's reliance on a small team (with vesting schedules for three core individuals and a product team) may present challenges in achieving milestones or managing workloads.

Third-Party Dependencies
The project depends on several third-party service providers for its technical stack, including blockchain networks (Base, Canton), cloud infrastructure (Vercel, Expo EAS), backend services (Supabase), and workflow orchestration (Temporal). Disruptions or changes in these services could impact project delivery.

Legal/Compliance Risks
Send operates as a non-custodial wallet, with users maintaining control of their funds and no KYC/AML requirements. However, evolving cryptocurrency regulations, especially those targeting privacy-focused services and cross-border payments, may pose compliance challenges. To mitigate such risks, the Foundation complies with all FATCA, CRS, and AML/CFT obligations under Cook Islands law. The Foundation shall also maintain accurate and complete record of accounting and treasury records for a minimum of six years.

Governance/Tokenomics Risks
Governance is managed by a four-member Foundation Council, with material decisions requiring a majority of three votes. Risks include council member availability, disagreements, succession planning, and multisig signer coordination. Tokenomics risks include vesting schedules for team and contributors, and the potential impact of token unlocks on the ecosystem.

**I.5: Technology-related risks**
Smart Contracts

Send deploys its smart contracts on the Base (Ethereum Layer 2) network, including an ERC-4337 smart wallet with biometric authentication, signature verification, a paymaster for gasless transactions, and a username-based payment system. This creates the risk of smart contract vulnerabilities that could negatively impact the project.

Cross-Chain

Send integrates a privacy layer via the Canton Network, with cross-chain bridge functionality between Base and Canton. The creates a cross-chain bridge risks.

Account abstraction & gasless UX
Send leans on an ERC-4337 smart-wallet model and a paymaster for gasless transactions. At scale, paymaster sponsorship means the project must reliably fund fees and operate AA infrastructure (bundlers/relayers) at volume; outages or cost spikes would degrade the "no-gas" experience.

L2 Dependencies

The project is dependent on the Base Layer 2 network for its primary operations, inheriting any risks associated with Base's infrastructure, security, and uptime.

**I.6: Mitigation measures**
The project plans to mitigate smart contract vulnerability through smart contract audits and open-source review. These measures will help identify and address potential vulnerabilities before deployment.
